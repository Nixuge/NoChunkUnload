# NoChunkUnload
A 1.8.9 Forge mod to prevent the client from unloading chunks.

Also lets you freeze the world.

Doesn't prevent chunk from being unshown due to the render distance*  

### Reasons for this mode
Chunks unloading was getting quite annoying on the "Mineplex Backup project"

### Other mod for 1.18+
